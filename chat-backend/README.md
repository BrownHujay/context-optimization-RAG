todo: 
- setup reranking (with qwen)
- setup summarization
- setup mongodb (ish)
- setup api for frontend
- setup qwen locally
- setup llm either locally or openai api

done:
- setup vectorstore to find using similarity and db
- base backend api
- database to store messages

next step:
- qwen reranking and embedding
- test the embeds
- summarization
- mongodb
- setup llm
- api for frontend
- better logic for saving
- frontend

nice to haves:
- animations: if deepseek, "thinking..." 
- view the bacakend thinking process
- stats
- chat page using LaTeX, Markdown, code blocks
- kinda like windsurf, have a graph to show what code language is most used, what you code the most, most used libraries, etc.
- charts would be kind of cool, maybe prompted off of the user data. (like statistcs for what rag data they pulled and how similar it is. )
